# Dynamic Pricing for Sports & Concert Tickets

![](Images/DynamicPricingExample.png)

## **Project Description**
This project proposes a **Reinforcement Learning (RL) and Neural Network-based dynamic pricing model** for sports and concert ticketing. The goal is to optimize ticket prices based on real-time demand to maximum revenue. 

### **What are you planning to do?**
We plan to use **Reinforcement Learning and Neural Networks** to dynamically adjust ticket prices. Using historical ticket sales, competitor pricing, event popularity, and sentiment analysis we will maximize profits. 

### **Why is your project exciting/fun/educational?**
This project is exciting because it bridges the fields of **machine learning and economics** together. It is also exciting because this is a very real aplication used in sites like ticketmaster and will enable us to understand better the inner workings of these wensites through creation.

### **What does success look like?**
Success will be defined by:
- The RL/NN model predicting demand fluctuations and dynamically changing the ticket prices.
- Maximizing shareholder value
- An ethical and fair pricing mechanism 

## **Project Goals**
1. Develop an RL-based pricing strategy
2. Optimizing revenue generated
3. Understanding the ideas behind these models and understanding how these opaque systems work better
