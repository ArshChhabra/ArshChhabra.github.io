# Neural Painter: AI-Generated Art from Stories & Poems

## Project Description
**Neural Painter** is an AI-powered application that transforms **poems, short stories, or descriptive text** into **dramatic paintings** in user-selected artistic styles. Using **natural language processing (NLP)** and **text-to-image neural networks**, this project aims to bring literature to life as visual art.

The AI will analyze the input text, extract **key themes, emotions, and imagery**, and generate a painting that reflects the mood and content of the text. Users can **choose an artistic style** (e.g., Impressionism, Gothic, Watercolor, Surrealism) to customize their artwork. 

This project explores the intersection of **language, creativity, and machine learning**, offering a novel way to visualize stories and poems. By leveraging advanced **deep learning models**, the AI will not only convert textual descriptions into images but will also adapt color palettes, brushstroke patterns, and composition techniques that align with the selected artistic style. Users will be able to experiment with different interpretations of their text, seeing how AI understands and represents their words in various visual forms.

Additionally, Neural Painter can be a powerful tool for **writers, educators, and artists**. Writers can see their narratives take form as digital paintings, educators can use it to illustrate literary concepts, and artists can experiment with AI-generated inspirations for their own work. This project also has the potential to **enhance digital storytelling**, enabling creators to seamlessly generate illustrated versions of their written content.

## Why is this project exciting?
- Bridges **literature, art, and AI** in a unique way.
- Explores how AI interprets **stories as visual elements**.
- Encourages creative expression and introduces AI-generated art.
- Provides a practical tool for **writers, educators, and artists**.
- Showcases the evolving capabilities of **text-to-image AI** in creative applications.

## What does success look like?
- The AI correctly extracts **key visual elements** from input text.
- The generated paintings accurately **reflect the story’s themes**.
- Users can interact with a **simple web interface** and select **different artistic styles**.
- The model successfully **adapts its visual output** based on both textual input and user-selected style.
- The system runs efficiently, producing high-quality images within a reasonable time frame.

## Project Goals
1. **Develop an NLP Model** to analyze text and extract key imagery.
2. **Train a Text-to-Image AI** (Stable Diffusion, DALL·E) to generate paintings.
3. **Implement Style Transfer** so users can choose an artistic style.
4. **Create a Web-Based Interface** where users can input text and generate paintings.
